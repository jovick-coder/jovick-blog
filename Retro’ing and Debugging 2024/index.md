Retro’ing and Debugging 2024: A Year of Growth, Challenges, and Breakthroughs

Introduction: Setting the Stage

2024 was a transformative year for me. It was filled with challenges that tested my limits, lessons that reshaped my approach to work and life, and achievements that made the journey unforgettable. Professionally, I took on projects that pushed my technical abilities to new heights, while personally, I experienced tremendous growth in self-development and financial education. Looking back, it was the year that truly set the foundation for a brighter future.

The Debugging Phase: Overcoming Challenges

Every significant year comes with its fair share of hurdles, and 2024 was no different. The most daunting challenge came while developing a rider application for Binnox. This project demanded more than I had initially anticipated, pushing me mentally and technically to the edge.

The app required optimizing the backend to reduce the number of requests and improve response speed. After weeks of research, I decided to integrate Socket.IO for real-time communication and Redis caching to minimize database delays and costs. However, the learning curve was steep, and I had less than two weeks to implement these technologies effectively. Sleepless nights became my norm as I raced against time to deliver.

Another major challenge was automating rider order assignments while considering factors like location. The system also needed to handle features such as order rejection, reassignment, and managing riders’ availability (online/offline status). Tackling these complex workflows in a short timeframe required relentless focus and perseverance.

With multiple projects on my plate and tight deadlines, balancing priorities became an everyday struggle. I relied heavily on task management tools like to-do lists and reminders to stay organized. Updating these lists every morning and night helped me stay on track and make progress despite the pressure.

The Retro Phase: Lessons Learned

Through these challenges, I learned the value of rapid learning and execution. Researching and building simultaneously became a skill I honed, and collaboration played a critical role in speeding up development. External support, including guidance from ChatGPT, proved invaluable in managing the technical aspects and keeping up with the fast pace.

Beyond technical growth, I discovered the importance of acting quickly to seize opportunities. This mindset extended to my financial decisions, where I learned to move swiftly to maximize investments and returns. The ability to adapt, prioritize, and execute effectively was perhaps the most significant lesson of the year.

Achievements: A Year to Remember

Despite the challenges, 2024 was also a year of incredible achievements. Professionally, I mastered advanced Node.js skills, including Socket.IO and Redis caching, which not only enhanced my technical expertise but also boosted my confidence in handling complex projects.

Financially, I made significant strides by acquiring two assets and making investments that I’m proud of. Learning to recognize and act on opportunities quickly paid off in ways I hadn’t imagined.

Spiritually, my role in organizing and managing our company’s prayer sessions was both fulfilling and rewarding. I witnessed firsthand how these sessions contributed to new investments, increased revenue, and overall growth for the company. It was a testament to the power of faith and collective effort.

On a personal level, my relationship flourished as my partner and I set and achieved personal and financial growth goals together. This synergy added an extra layer of fulfillment to an already remarkable year.

Looking Ahead: Vision for 2025

As I step into 2025, I’m determined to build on the momentum of 2024. My roadmap includes a return to technical writing and active engagement on social media to share knowledge and connect with like-minded professionals. Financially, I’m saving and planning for a significant investment in the fourth quarter of the year, with the goal of further securing my future.

I’m also committed to improving the habits that served me well in 2024—learning, building, and investing—while striving for growth in every area of my life. With clear goals and a determined mindset, I’m ready to tackle the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

Conclusion

2024 was a year of debugging and retrospection, a time of challenges and breakthroughs that reshaped my personal and professional journey. As I look ahead to 2025, I carry forward the lessons, achievements, and experiences that have prepared me for whatever lies ahead. Here’s to another year of growth, learning, and success!
