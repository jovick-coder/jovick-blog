Retro'ing and Debugging 2024: A Year of Development, Difficulties, and Innovation

Overview: Establishing the Scene

For me, 2024 was a year of transformation. It was full with obstacles that pushed me to the limit, teachings that changed the way I approach both work and life, and successes that made the trip one to remember. In my professional life, I embarked on projects that challenged my technical skills to the limit, and in my personal life, I made significant progress in my financial literacy and self-development. In retrospect, it was the year that genuinely laid the groundwork for a better future.




The Debugging Stage: Getting Past Obstacles

There are challenges associated with any big year, and 2024 was no exception. The most difficult obstacle was creating a Binnox rider application. I was pushed to the limit both technically and mentally by this project, which required more than I had first thought.

To decrease the volume of queries and increase response time, the application's backend needed to be optimised. After weeks of investigation, I chose to combine Redis caching and Socket.IO for real-time communication in order to reduce database expenses and delays. But there was a severe learning curve, and I had less than two weeks to successfully integrate these technologies. As I rushed to deliver, I started to have sleepless nights.


Automating rider order assignments while taking location into account was another significant problem. Features like order rejection, reassignment, and controlling riders' availability (online/offline status) also have to be handled by the system. It took unwavering concentration and persistence to tackle these intricate operations in a short amount of time.

Managing priorities became a daily issue for me because I had a lot of projects to do and deadlines to meet. To keep organised, I mostly depended on task management tools like reminders and to-do lists. Despite the strain, I was able to stay on course and make progress by updating these lists every morning and evening.



The Retro Era: Knowledge Acquired

These difficulties taught me the importance of quick learning and execution. I developed the ability to research and build at the same time, and teamwork was essential to accelerating progress. Having outside assistance, such as advice from ChatGPT, was crucial for handling the technical parts and keeping up with the rapid pace.

In addition to developing technically, I learnt how crucial it is to move fast to take advantage of chances. I applied this way of thinking to my financial decisions as well, learning to act quickly to optimise investments and profits. The year's most important lesson was probably how to prioritise, adapt, and perform well.


Accomplishments: A Year to Recall

Notwithstanding the difficulties, 2024 also saw some amazing accomplishments. In my professional life, I developed sophisticated Node.js abilities, such as Socket.IO and Redis caching, which improved my technical proficiency and gave me more self-assurance when managing challenging projects.

By obtaining two assets and making investments I'm proud of, I made major financial progress. Acquiring the ability to spot and seize opportunities fast paid dividends in unexpected ways.

It was a spiritually satisfying and gratifying experience for me to plan and oversee our company's prayer meetings. I personally saw how these meetings boosted the company's overall growth, brought in new investors, and raised sales. It was evidence of the strength of faith and teamwork.

As my spouse and I set and accomplished financial and personal development goals together, our relationship grew on a personal level. An already incredible year was made even more fulfilling by this synergy.


Looking Ahead: 2025 Vision

I'm committed to building on the momentum from 2024 as I enter 2025. A return to technical writing and active participation on social media to exchange knowledge and establish connections with like-minded people are part of my agenda. In order to further secure my future, I'm saving money and making plans for a sizable investment in the fourth quarter of the year.

Along with aiming for progress in all facets of my life, I'm also dedicated to strengthening the habits that helped me in 2024â€”learning, investing, and building. I'm prepared to take on the chances and difficulties that lie ahead because I have clear goals and a determined mindset.


In conclusion

2024 was a year of reflection and debugging, filled with obstacles and discoveries that changed the course of my career and personal life. I bring with me the knowledge, successes, and experiences that have equipped me for whatever the future holds as I look to 2025. Cheers to another year of development, education, and achievement!
