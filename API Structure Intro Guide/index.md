## Introduction to Structuring APIs in Node.js

APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, connecting the front end with the server. However, a poorly structured API can lead to messy, unmaintainable code. For beginners diving into Node.js, understanding how to organize your project from the start is key to building scalable, clean applications.

This guide will walk you through the basics of structuring a Node.js REST API. We‚Äôll cover the essentials, best practices, and provide a practical folder structure you can adapt for your projects.

### Why is API Structure Important?
When starting out, many developers throw everything into one file. While this works for small projects, it becomes a nightmare as your codebase grows. A good API structure helps with:
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to locate and modify code.
- **Scalability**: Allows your application to grow without breaking.
- **Collaboration**: Helps teams understand the code quickly.
- **Readability**: Clean code is easier to debug and extend.

---

### Core Concepts for Structuring APIs
Before jumping into folder structures, let‚Äôs understand some foundational principles:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep different parts of your app (e.g., routes, database, logic) in separate files to avoid mixing responsibilities.
2. **Modularity**: Break your code into reusable modules.
3. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data like database credentials securely using a `.env` file.

---

### Basic API Folder Structure
Here‚Äôs a simple structure for small projects, perfect for absolute beginners:

```plaintext
my-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js          # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Project metadata and dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env               # Environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /routes            # API route definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userRoutes.js  # Example: User-related routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /controllers       # Request-handling logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userController.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /models            # Database models or schemas
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ userModel.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /config            # Configuration files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js          # Database connection setup
```

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. server.js
The entry point of your application:
- Sets up the Express server.
- Loads middleware and routes.

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
const connectDB = require('./config/db');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// Database Connection
connectDB();

// Routes
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

---

#### 2. Environment Variables (`.env`)
Use a `.env` file to store sensitive data:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/myDatabase
```

Install `dotenv` to load these variables into `process.env`:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

---

#### 3. Routes
Routes handle HTTP requests and point them to the appropriate controller.

**`/routes/userRoutes.js`:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { getAllUsers, createUser } = require('../controllers/userController');
const router = express.Router();

// GET all users
router.get('/', getAllUsers);

// POST create a new user
router.post('/', createUser);

module.exports = router;
```

---

#### 4. Controllers
Controllers contain the logic for handling requests.

**`/controllers/userController.js`:**
```javascript
const User = require('../models/userModel');

// GET all users
const getAllUsers = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find();
    res.status(200).json(users);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};

// POST create a new user
const createUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email } = req.body;
    const newUser = await User.create({ name, email });
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
  }
};

module.exports = { getAllUsers, createUser };
```

---

#### 5. Models
Models define the structure of your database documents. In this example, we use MongoDB and Mongoose.

**`/models/userModel.js`:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

---

#### 6. Configuration
The configuration folder contains files for connecting to external resources, such as databases.

**`/config/db.js`:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

---

### Best Practices
1. **Keep Code DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating logic; reuse functions and modules where possible.
2. **Error Handling:** Always handle errors gracefully using `try-catch` blocks or middleware.
3. **Use Middleware:** For tasks like authentication, request validation, and logging.
4. **Versioning Your API:** Use versioning (`/api/v1/users`) to handle future updates without breaking old clients.

---

### Real-World Use Cases
Here are some ideas to practice:
- A blog API (users, posts, and comments).
- A task manager API (tasks, users, and deadlines).

---

### Conclusion
Starting with a clean, structured API is the foundation of a maintainable project. By separating concerns and organizing your code logically, you‚Äôll set yourself up for success as your application grows.

Remember, this is just a starting point! As you gain experience, you can adapt and expand this structure to fit larger, more complex projects.
